    /**What is the function interface in Java 8?
     -->The Function interface is defined in the java.util.function package.
     -->It contains one abstract method that is known as apply() method.
     -->This interface accepts the input and provides output. It takes one parameter as input and produces the output.
     -->This interface is used in a lambda expression and method reference to evaluate the condition.

     *Advantage of Function:-
     1. By use of Function Interface, you can move the operational code to one place.
     2. It improves code maintenance because if you want to perform operations on the object then you have to make it in a central place.*/
