     --->It contains one abstract method that is known as accept() method.
     --->This interface accepts a single input argument and doesnâ€™t return the result.
     --->The Consumer interface is useful when an object needs to be consumed.
     --->It takes an object as input and you can perform the operation on an object without returning any result.
     --->This interface is used in a lambda expression and method reference where the user wants to perform the operation without returning the object.*/

/**Advantage of Consumer:-
 1. By use of Consumer, you can move the operation to one place.
 2. It improves code maintenance if you want to make any change in one place.*/
