         *The distinct() method returns a new stream consisting of the distinct elements from the given stream.
         *For checking the equality of the stream elements, the equals() method is used.
         *The distinct() method guarantees the ordering for the streams backed by an ordered collection.
         *For ordered streams, the element appearing first in the encounter order is preserved.
         *For unordered streams, no stability guarantees are made. */
